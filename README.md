Automating Author Metadata Management within Obsidian Using ORCID, BIBO, and Automation Scripts

Overview

This repository provides a solution for managing and automating the ingestion of author metadata within Obsidian. By connecting with the ORCID API and using BIBO (Bibliographic Ontology) standards, and custom Python scripts, this integration facilitates the ingestion, organisation, and updating of author information, publications, and related metrics.

Features
BIBO-Aligned YAML Templates: Structured templates for author profiles ensuring semantic richness and interoperability.
Automated Metadata Ingestion: Python scripts that fetch and update author data from multiple sources, including ORCID, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Altmetrics.
Zotero Citekey Integration: Maintains consistency by using Zotero-generated citekeys for publications.
Altmetrics Data Integration: Includes overall impact scores and mentions across various media platforms.
Error Logging: Robust logging mechanism to track and resolve issues during data ingestion.
Scalable Structure: Designed to handle large vaults with thousands of documents and authors.
